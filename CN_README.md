## Purpose

This github repo contains the necessary files to complete the Week 4 Programming Assignment for the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course. Alongside this README file, the repo also contains the R-script used to complete the assignment, the output of the R-script saved as a text file and a 'code book' describing what was done to the raw data files.

The requirements of the R-script as described in the assignment are as follows: 

  1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  
  2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  
  3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  
  4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  
  5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject


## Files in Repo

```CN_run_analysis.R``` : the created R-script that will perform all needed actions requested by the assignment guidelines (see 'CN_CodeBook.md')


```CN_tidydata.txt ``` : the finalized and tidy data set outputted by the R-script


```CN_CodeBook.md``` : the 'code book' that details each step of the R-script and provides additional information regarding the data used


```CN_README.md``` : the file you're reading right now
